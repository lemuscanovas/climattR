## Why this package
To date there is no R package available which have implemented the simple but effective flow analogues methodology to perform extreme weather event attribution. `climattR` contains a set of functions to 1) prepare data to employ flow analogues; 2) Find flow analogue days to a target date; 3) Reconstruct surface fields for extreme weather events in past and present (also future) climate conditions;
